# Introduction

OASIS Best Current Practices documents (OBCP) are developed to assist
individuals, groups, and organizations that do work at OASIS. The high-level
goals of these documents are to remove variability and provide simple and easy
to use examples and templates on how one might accomplish common tasks at
OASIS.

While these documents are optional to adopt, they represent the current best
practices as defined by the community of members at OASIS.
