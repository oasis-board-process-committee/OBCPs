# What does ‘open’ mean 

At OASIS, we talk a lot about openness. We follow open processes, develop open standards, etc. But what does that mean in practice? Who does it apply to, and when? 
What obligations does it make on a project's participants or a standards user? How do you know if you are doing it right? 

This note is an effort to explain that. Note that this is an unofficial overview. For the official language, turn to OASIS policy documents.

## Defining 'Openness'

In its definition of openness, freedictionary.com includes several descriptive qualities that are relevant to our work:

- Affording unobstructed entrance and exit; not shut or closed
- Affording unobstructed passage or view
- Carried on in full view of others; not hidden or private
- Accessible to all; unrestricted as to participants

At OASIS, we follow these principles. In order to ensure that our work is open, our rules require that: 

- Any interested party, unless precluded for legal reasons, can join a project and participate in its work and decision-making. The members of a project cannot 
unilaterally exclude anyone. 
- Activities of the project, such as meetings, must be announced publicly, via OASIS approved tools, and scheduled to enable the greatest number of people to 
participate.
- Once content has been contributed to the project, any decisions affecting it must take place in open meetings or properly held ballots. Discussions can take place on opaque tools like Slack, but decisions cannot be made behind closed doors.
- Any member of a project can make proposals, recommendations, suggestions, or contributions to the team and have them receive due consideration. 
- All parties agree that their contributions will be subject to the IP rules chosen when the project began.
- Channels are provided so that outsiders can offer feedback and material to the project (although they cannot take part in discussions, consideration, or resolution).
- No group is favored or given the power to dominate the work. This doesn't mean that a group can't come to exercise outsized influence. But they do it through their work and participation; the rules don't give anyone an edge.
- There will be no undue financial barriers to participating. This doesn't mean membership must be free. But OASIS structures its fee schedule to make participation affordable to all sizes and types of organizations.  
- Voting rights are determined by the OASIS rules. They are not controlled by one party nor can they be made dependent on technical qualifications or other requirements beyond what is spelled out in the rules.
- Official actions of a committee, especially those that establish a milestone result such as voting on a document approval, are recorded using OASIS-provided tools that are publicly visible. 
- Official copies of the resources of a committee (e.g. document drafts, meeting minutes, email lists, ballots) must be stored on facilities designated by OASIS and publicly visible. Opaque channels such as Slack or Telegraph, while convenient for casual conversation, cannot be used for official work or decision-making.  
- All official deliverables of an OASIS project such as Specification Drafts or OASIS Standards are publicly accessible, free of charge, and available in perpetuity. OASIS does not charge for accessing or using its standards. 

## When and where does Openness start?

Openness goes both ways. When a party joins an OASIS Open Project, there are also a couple of obligations associated with this.

The obligations begin to apply at two checkpoints: when you join a project and agree to abide by its rules, and when you make a contribution to that project. 

The first happens when you take action to join a project: 

- For a Technical Committee, when you join it, you acknowledge that your work will be done in compliance with the OASIS rules and in accordance with the IPR mode chosen when the TC was started. 
- For an Open Project, your signing the CLAs (Contributor License Agreements - individual and, if necessary, entity CLAs) accomplishes the same goal. 

Before you contribute work to the project, it is not subject to the openness requirements. For example, you may be preparing a draft document on your personal computer prior to turning it over to the project. It has not yet been contributed, so OASIS rules do not apply. We would not expect to have open access to it. 

Contribution happens when you take action to deliver material from your personal possession over to the project for its consideration. This can be done by uploading a copy to a project's document repository, submitting it via a pull request, or sending it to the project's email list as an attachment - anything that transmits a physical copy to the project. Subsequent iterations of the work would be expected to take place on the publicly visible platforms used by the committee. Obviously, this doesn't mean every keystroke from then on must be recorded; but any iteration of the work that others are expected to read, respond to, or consider must be publicly visible. 

Note that sending a hyperlink does not constitute a contribution; a complete copy of the asset must be transmitted to the project.

By contributing content to a project, you give the project a non-exclusive license to incorporate it into project work products. You retain your rights in the work. Portions of the work incorporated into OASIS work products become copyrighted of OASIS. Note that you cannot retract a contribution. Once made, the contribution, even if not used further, is expected to remain available on the OASIS platform.
