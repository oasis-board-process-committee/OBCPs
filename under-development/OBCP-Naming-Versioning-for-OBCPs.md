# 1 Introduction

OASIS Best Current Practices documents (OBCP) are developed to assist
individuals, groups, and organizations that do work at OASIS. The high-level
goals of these documents are to remove variability and provide simple and easy
to use examples and templates on how one might accomplish common tasks at
OASIS.

While these documents are optional to adopt, they represent the current best
practices as defined by the community of members at OASIS.

To make it easier to use and reference OBCPs, the following requirements are
defined for the naming and versioning of all OBCPs.

---

# 2 Requirements

## 2.1 Versioning

While OBCPs may be deprecated or replaced over time, they represent the current
best practices for doing work at OASIS.

To make it easier and more recognizable when referencing an OBCP, all
OBCPs use a 4 digit year plus two digit month as their version
(e.g., 2023.03). This verson represent the calendar month in which the
OBCP was released. 

## 2.2 Naming

To assist with the referencing of OBCPs, all OBCPs will be issued a number,
which is an incrementing integer from a central repository maintained by OASIS.
The full published name and version of each OBCP will be as follows: 

OBCP:#, Long Name, Version:YEAR.MONTH

**Example**

OBCP:1, Naming and Versioning Requirements for OBCPs, Version:2023.09

## 2.3 Referencing an OBCP

When referencing a published OBCP document an author or editor can use
either the full OBCP name, or the following shortened syntax: 

OBCP:#:YEAR.MONTH

**Examples**

OBCP:1, Naming and Versioning Requirements for OBCPs, Version:2023.09

OBCP:1:2023.09
