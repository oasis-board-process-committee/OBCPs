# 1 Introduction

This OASIS Best Current Practices documents (OBCP) document provides guidelines for using the git protocol to collaobrate on documents in an OASIS Technical Committee (TC) or Open Project (OP) board or committee.


# 2 When to use git

Can this be used as the official publication process or can it contain an authoritative version?

Not for specifications
https://www.oasis-open.org/policies-guidelines/open-repositories/#independentResources

Should every group have its own Organization or just a repo (like what we do today)?
- Doing this would allow Github.io pages

- or something in between

# 6 Administering a git repository
