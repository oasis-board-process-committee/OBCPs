# 1 Introduction

OASIS Best Current Practices documents (OBCP) are developed to assist
individuals, groups, and organizations that do work at OASIS. The high-level
goals of these documents are to remove variability and provide simple and easy
to use examples and templates on how one might accomplish common tasks at
OASIS.

While these documents are optional to adopt, they represent the current best
practices as defined by the community of members at OASIS.

To make it easier to use and reference OBCPs, the following requirements are
defined for the naming and versioning of all OBCPs.

---

# 2 Requirements

## 2.1 Versioning

While OBCPs may be deprecated or replaced over time, they represent the current
best practices for doing work at OASIS.

To make it easier and more recognizable when referencing an OBCP, all
OBCPs **MUST** use a 4 digit year plus two digit month as their version
(e.g., 2023.03). This verson **MUST** represent the calendar month in which the
OBCP was released. 

## 2.2 Naming

To assist with the referencing of OBCPs, all OBCPs will be issued a number,
which is an incrementing integer from a central repository maintained by OASIS.
The full published name and version of each OBCP **MUST** be as follows: 

OBCP:#, Long Name, Version:YEAR.MONTH

**Example**

OBCP:1, Naming and Versioning Requirements for OBCPs, Version:2023.03

## 2.3 Referencing an OBCP

When referencing a published OBCP document an author or editor **MUST** use
either the full OBCP name, or the following shortened syntax: 

OBCP:#:YEAR.MONTH

**Examples**

OBCP:1, Naming and Versioning Requirements for OBCPs, Version:2023.03

OBCP:1:2023.03

---

# 3 Conformance

All OASIS Best Current Practices documents **MUST** use the naming and versioning requirements defined in this document.

All OASIS organizations that reference an OBCP **MUST** use the referencing format defined in this document.

# Appendix A. References

This appendix contains the normative and informative references that are used in this document. Normative references are specific (identified by date of publication and/or edition number or version number) and Informative references are either specific or non-specific. For specific references, only the cited version applies. For non-specific references, the latest version of the reference document (including any amendments) applies. While any hyperlinks included in this appendix were valid at the time of publication, OASIS cannot guarantee their long term validity.
