# 1 Introduction

This document defines guidelines for running an official meeting of an [OASIS] [Commitee]].  It distinguishes a [Committee Meeting] from other meetings, include suggested tasks for preparing for a meeting, suggested guidance for managing situations that often arise during meetings, and requirements for documenting the results of a meeting afterward.

---

# 2 Types of Meetings

It is very important to distinguish whether meetings and other gatherings are official [Committee Meetings].

## 2.1 Committee Meetings

Each [OASIS] [Committee], including each [Technical Committee], [Project Governing Board] and Open Project [Technical Steering Committee], is **REQUIRED** **(LINK?)** to periodically schedule and hold a [Committee Meeting] of the active [Members].  All [Voting] of the [Committee], including [Resolutions] (e.g. approval of any [Work Products]) or election of [Chairs], **SHOULD** be made either at a [Committee Meeting], after establishing [Quorum], or through other approved means, such as an [Electronic Ballot].

[OASIS]: https://oasis-open.org

[Committee]: https://www.oasis-open.org/policies-guidelines/oasis-committee-operations-process/#committees

[Committee Meeting]: https://www.oasis-open.org/policies-guidelines/oasis-committee-operations-process/#meetings

[Members]: https://www.oasis-open.org/policies-guidelines/oasis-defined-terms-2018-05-22/#dMember

[Chairs]: https://www.oasis-open.org/policies-guidelines/oasis-defined-terms-2018-05-22/#dChair

[Quorum]: https://www.oasis-open.org/policies-guidelines/oasis-defined-terms-2018-05-22/#dQuorum

[Voting]: https://www.oasis-open.org/policies-guidelines/oasis-committee-operations-process/#voting

[Resolutions]: https://www.oasis-open.org/policies-guidelines/oasis-defined-terms-2018-05-22/#dResolution

[Work Products]: https://www.oasis-open.org/policies-guidelines/oasis-defined-terms-2018-05-22/#dWorkProduct

[Electronic Ballot]: https://www.oasis-open.org/policies-guidelines/tc-process-2017-05-26/tc-process-16-september-2002/#mail

[Technical Committee]: https://www.oasis-open.org/policies-guidelines/oasis-defined-terms-2018-05-22/#dTechnicalCommittee

[Project Governing Board]: https://www.oasis-open.org/policies-guidelines/oasis-defined-terms-2018-05-22/#dPGB

## 2.2 Ad-hoc/side meetings

[Members] and/or non-Members of a [Committee] **MAY** gather and discuss topics of interest to the [Committee] outside the scope of a [Committee Meeting].  However, unless these gatherings satisfy the rules of a [Committee Meeting], including being scheduled and announced in advance as a [Committee Meeting], these "ad-hoc" or "side" meetings **MUST NOT** be considered an official [Committee Meeting]. 

# 3 Preparing For Committee Meetings

It is important to determine, in advance of each [Committee Meeting] the participants, schedule and agenda for the meeting.

## 3.1 Participants

Each [Committee Meeting] is open to all [Eligible Persons], including [Members] and [Observers] of the [Committee] and other [Individual Members] of [OASIS]. All other persons should **MUST NOT** be invited to or alloowed to attend, participate or contribute to the [Committee Meeting].

## 3.2 Scheduling

Each [Meeting] **MUST** be scheduled in advance with sufficient time to allow the maximum participation by [Members] of the [Committee].

Calendar invitations to each [Committee Meeting] **MUST** be sent to all [Members] of the [Committee], and **SHOULD** also be sent to all [Observers] of the [Committee]. 

For instance, when a [Technical Committee] meeting is scheduled in the TC Workspace ("Kavi"), [Members] and [Observers] of the [Committee] are automatically notified by email.

[Meeting]: https://www.oasis-open.org/policies-guidelines/oasis-committee-operations-process/#meetings

## 3.3 Agenda

Per [Robert's Rules] of Order, in advance of each [Committee Meeting], an agenda **SHOULD** be distributed to all invited persons, including [Members] and [Observers].

The agenda **SHOULD** include a roster of [Members] and [Observers] including the current voting status of each participant.

[Robert's Rules]: https://robertsrules.com/

[Eligible Persons]: https://www.oasis-open.org/policies-guidelines/oasis-defined-terms-2018-05-22/#dEligiblePerson

[Observers]: https://www.oasis-open.org/policies-guidelines/oasis-defined-terms-2018-05-22/#dObserver

[Individual Members]: https://www.oasis-open.org/policies-guidelines/oasis-defined-terms-2018-05-22/#dIndividualMember

# 4 Managing Committee Meetings

During a [Committee Meeting], it is important to admit particpants and establish quorum.

## 4.1 Admitting Participants

To prevent abuse by non-TC members, either:
1. The [Chairs], and/or their designee(s), **SHOULD** have a means to limit attendance to [Eligible Persons] (e.g. a waiting room), **OR**
2. The credentials required to attend the [Committee Meeting] **SHOULD** be shared with all [Eligible Persons] only in a separate communication from the invitation itself.

## 4.2 Establishing Quorum

[Voting] on [Resolutions] at a [Committee Meeting] **REQUIRES** a [Quorum] be present. For a [Committee] that tracks [Voting Members], a [Quorum] is a simple majority of the [Voting Members].  Otherwise, a [Quorum] is a simple majority of the [Members].

For instance, when a [Technical Committee] meeting is scheduled in the TC Workspace ("Kavi") and [Members] and [Observers] register their attendance, whether the attendance at the [Committee Meeting] satisfies the [Quorum] will be identifed in the workspace.

If a [Quorum] is not present at a [Committee Meeting], the [Committee] **MAY** still meet and discuss the agenda but any [Voting] **MUST NOT** occur.

[Voting Members]: https://www.oasis-open.org/policies-guidelines/oasis-defined-terms-2018-05-22/#dVotingMember

## 4.3 Adopting The Agenda

Per [Robert's Rules], unless the [Committee] uses the [Standard Order of Business], the [Committee] **SHOULD** approve the agenda at the start of each [Committee Meeting].

[Minutes]: https://github.com/oasis-board-process-committee/OBCPs/blob/main/under-development/OBCP-2-meeting-minutes.md

[Standard Order of Business]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agenda_(meeting)#Standard_Order_of_Business

## 4.4 Approving Previous Minutes

Per [Robert's Rules], correction and approval of any unapproved [Minutes] from a previous [Committee Meeting] **SHOULD** be one of the first items on the agenda at each [Committee Meeting].

# 5 Documenting Committee Meetings

After a [Committee Meeting], it is important to publish the minutes, and update the voting status of all [Members].

## 5.1 Distrbuting Draft Minutes

Per [Robert's Rules], the [Chairs] or Secretaries, if they exist, in each [Committee] **MUST** distribute a record of the discussions and [Resolutions] of the [Committee], including draft [Minutes] following each [Committee Meeting].

The [Members] **SHOULD** review the draft [Minutes] and suggest any corrections prior to approval at the next [Committee Meeting].

## 5.2 Updating Voting Members

In each [Committee] that tracks [Voting Members] and after each [Committee Meeting], the [Chairs] **SHOULD** review the attendance of each [Member] to determine whether they are [Voting Members] prior to the next [Committee Meeting].  Attendance or non-attendance at meetings other than a [Committee Meeting] **MUST NOT** affect the status of [Members] as [Voting Members].
