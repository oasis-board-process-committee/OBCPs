# Importance of Minutes 

The minutes of a project are a key part of its historical record. They are useful for members who miss a meeting or as documentation of decisions made and action items assigned. Crucially, they memorialize attendance to assist with maintaining voting rights, document whether the meeting had quorum, and capture motions and votes. For many steps in the OASIS workflow, minutes are required when requesting support actions from OASIS staff.

To help meet OASIS’s principle of maximizing visibility into project work, we recommend the following practices as most likely to result in concise, accurate minutes that will be as useful in the future as they are today. 

 

# Requirements of OASIS process

The OASIS requirements for meeting minutes are deliberately minimal so that they do not become a burden. OASIS policies only require that:

* Minutes be posted to a committee’s primary mailing list;
* Minutes record individual attendance at the meeting; and
* Minutes record decisions taken. 
 
# Recommendations for Meeting Minutes
 
* Line up a scribe to keep the minutes in advance. If your project appoints a Secretary, that person is generally responsible for minutes. 

* Publish the text of your minutes directly in the body of the email message. While attaching a PDF or word processing file to the email is acceptable, it makes searching for your minutes later much more difficult. 

Note that you can keep draft minutes in a mutable format such as a wiki or a Google Doc. However, you should treat these as scratch pad formats. The final, approved minutes must be fixed and immutable. (A word processing document qualifies once it is loaded into your document repository.) Project Administration will not act on motions documented in wikis or other temporary formats.

* Use the word “Minutes” in the subject line, along with the project name. For example, “OSLC-OP Meeting Minutes 2023-04-20"

This seems obvious but it happens, and it is very frustrating to search your mail archive for the word “minutes” and find nothing.

If you do choose to write the minutes in a word processing file and load it to your document repository, use “Minutes” and the meeting date in the title of the document. This will ensure that the word appears in the automatically generated email sent from the repository. 

* List attendees and absences at the top of your minutes.

One helpful addition here would be a statement of who gained or lost voting rights as of the last meeting and other changes in status such as Leaves of Absence. 

* Draft minutes as soon after the meeting as possible

It is best to draft TC minutes within a day or two while your memory is fresh.

* Capture only the key points from the meeting. 

Minutes are not a transcript of every comment or response made during a meeting. Capturing all the nuances of an active discussion is difficult and prone to error. 

Minutes should typically contain:

  * The date and time of the meeting;
  * Attendes and absentees and whether quorum was achieved; 
  * The meeting agenda;
  * Approval of previous minutes;
  * Action items assigned such as agreed editorial changes to a specification;
  * Motions made, who made the motion, who seconded, and whether it passed or failed;
  * Details of other votes important to record; and 
  * Date and time of the next meeting.  

Circulating drafts of expected motions to the members ahead of the meeting can save valuable working time while you are together. You can discuss and fine-tune the wording of the motion and gauge whether it has enough support to pass ahead of time, not during the actual meeting time. This also enables your minutes to be pre-populated with the motions beforehand. 

# Minutes are draft until approved

Minutes should be considered draft until approved in a project meeting.

# Simple minutes template

Here is a simple template that you can use for your meeting minutes.

Title:  Minutes <project-name> meeting <date>

Agenda:

<list of agenda items with any pre-planned motions listed>

Attendees:

<list of members attending>

Absent: 

<list of any members not present> 

The meeting <had / did not have> quorum (XX of YY Voting Members).

Action items:

-       <name of assignee> - <action item assigned and status>

Announcements:

<list of any general announcements made>

Approval of minutes:

<motion to approve previous minutes. it is acceptable to approve minutes pending corrections raised in the meeting> 

< Individual agenda items >

<for each item on the agenda, list of topics raised, motions made and outcome, straw polls taken, etc.>

Any other business:

<document any other business raised and its disposition>

Next meeting date and time

<date and time for the next meeting>
